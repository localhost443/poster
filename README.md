# Welcome To POSTER ? 

# What is POSTER ?

Well, This is a simple microservice that I have created my syself and made it opensource so that Anyone can study it, edit it or modify it as their own wish. .
**It has A built in Event Broker that build from scratch** 
**Used ExpressJS to built out the Server**
**Easy to understand every bit of codes**
**Simple and easy to use**
**Built for study** 


## Installing POSTER

Just clone this with GIT , Run yarn install to install all the requires files and addons that needed. Run **yarn start** to start the server

## What framework used here ?

I have used **React** and **TailwindCSS** to build up the frontEnd
**Express** as a backend Server
**Axios** for request to one server to another server . 

## Using for production

You should never use the **Event Broker** in a Production server. Because I build it up from the scratch and it lacks many many features that production grade Event Broker uses. There are many event broker available in the internet . Please use google a little bit `
